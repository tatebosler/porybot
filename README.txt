Logs have been updated for battles up to 2:00 pm Monday, June 10. If you need even
newer logs, you'll need PHP 7 and Composer, and run the following commands from the
root of the project (in order):
- cd retriever
- composer install (or `php composer.phar install` if you've installed Composer locally)
- php cron.php
- cp logs/*.txt ../logs/
